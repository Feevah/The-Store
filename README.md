# The Shop
## This is an app I am building using arrays to keep an inventory of products.
### It should allow the user to see what is available and how much of that product is available.

## Still a lot to do as I'd like to incorporate this code into my Pallet Project to keep inventory of the pallets in stock. 
 
- [X] Create an inventory array and associate a number with each item. Then get user input that purchases items (subtracts one from the item).
- [ ] Make a function that will repeat above item with any item in array. If you have any input @axecopfire  I'm working on method 2 in my store.js file.


# Grocery Store app functions:

- [ ] add to inventory
- [ ] subtract from inventory
- [ ] Notify when out of stock
 
# data:
- [ ] inventory
- [ ] inventory count
