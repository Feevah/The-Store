# The Shop
## This is an app I built using arrays to keep an inventory of products.
### It should allow the user to see what is available and how much of that product is available.

## Still a lot to do as I'd like to incorporate this code into my Pallet Project to keep inventory of the pallets in stock.
 
- [ ] Create an inventory array and associate a number with each item. Then get user input that purchases items (subtracts one from the item).

# Grocery Store app functions:

- [ ] add to inventory
- [ ] subtract from inventory
- [ ] Notify when out of stock
 
# data:
- [ ] inventory
- [ ] inventory count
